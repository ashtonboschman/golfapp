1️⃣ Make sure you’re on main
git checkout main
git pull


Ensures your local main is up-to-date with GitHub.

2️⃣ Create a new branch

Let’s call it feature/dashboard:

git checkout -b feature/dashboard


-b creates and switches to the new branch.

Naming convention: feature/<feature-name> keeps branches organized.

3️⃣ Work on your new feature

Any changes you make now (Dashboard page, protected routes, etc.) are isolated from main.

You can safely commit:

git add .
git commit -m "Add dashboard page placeholder and protected route"

4️⃣ Push your branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/dashboard


This creates a remote branch so you can open a Pull Request (PR) later if you want.

✅ Recommended workflow

Feature branches for each new page/feature:

feature/dashboard

feature/add-round

feature/leaderboard

Commit frequently with clear messages.

Merge into main only when the feature is tested and stable:

git checkout main
git merge feature/dashboard
git push


Delete the branch if no longer needed:

git branch -d feature/dashboard
git push origin --delete feature/dashboard


If you want, I can now create the Dashboard page and a ProtectedRoute component so /dashboard is accessible only after login, and we can commit it directly to this new branch.
